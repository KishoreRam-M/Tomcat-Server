### Understanding Navigation and Troubleshooting in a Deployed WAR File

A **WAR (Web Application Archive)** file is a compressed file format used for deploying web applications in Java-based environments like **Tomcat**. It contains all the components of a web application, such as HTML files, Java servlets, and configuration files. Let’s break down the key concepts and how the various parts of the WAR file work together.

### **Key Components in the Example WAR File (`hi3.war`)**

We are looking at the WAR file named `hi3.war`. When you unpack a WAR file, it typically contains several important directories and files that make up the web application. Below is the **output of the 'jar tvf hi3.war' command** and the corresponding **file structure**.

#### **File Structure:**
```
hiTop.html                        ## in top-level directory
    |
+---------------+--------------+
|                              |
web-assets                       WEB-INF
    -- hiNested.html              | -- web.xml    ## in WEB-INF subdirectory
                                 |
                              classes
                                 |
                               p1
                                  -- HiServlet.class  ## in WEB-INF/classes/p1 subdirectory
```

### **Explanation of Key Files:**

1. **hiTop.html** (in the top-level directory):
   - This is an HTML file located at the root of the WAR. When the app is deployed, it will be accessible directly through the browser.
   
2. **web-assets/hiNested.html**:
   - This is another HTML file, but it’s inside the `web-assets` folder. This folder can hold other static resources, such as images or additional HTML files.

3. **WEB-INF/web.xml**:
   - This is a configuration file where the web application’s configuration details are stored, such as servlet mappings, filters, etc. This file is not directly accessible via URL for security reasons.

4. **WEB-INF/classes/p1/HiServlet.class**:
   - This is a **Java class** that defines a servlet, a Java program that responds to HTTP requests. It’s inside the `classes` directory, which holds all compiled Java classes.

### **Navigation Within the WAR File:**

When the WAR file is deployed on a Tomcat server, the navigation within the application depends on the **file structure** and how Tomcat maps those files to URLs.

- For example, **hiTop.html** will be available at `http://...:8080/hi3/hiTop.html`.
- The **hiNested.html** file inside the `web-assets` directory can be accessed through `http://...:8080/hi3/web-assets/hiNested.html`.
- The **HiServlet** class will handle HTTP requests mapped in the `web.xml` file, which connects a URL pattern to the servlet.

---

### **Tomcat Context and Context Root:**

- **Context**: In Tomcat, the **context** is essentially the name of the deployed web application. When you deploy a WAR file, Tomcat uses the WAR file name (without the `.war` extension) as the context. For example, if the WAR file is named `hi3.war`, the context is `hi3`.

- **Context Root**: This refers to the root of the web application’s deployment. In this case, the root context would be `/hi3/`. This means that all URLs for this application are relative to `http://...:8080/hi3/`.

---

### **Tomcat’s Root Context:**

- When you visit the URL `http://...:8080/`, you are accessing the **root context** of Tomcat, which by default displays the Tomcat homepage. The root context maps to the `ROOT` directory in `TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/`.

---

### **Miscellaneous Deployment Issues:**

1. **URL Breakdown**:
   - `http://...:8080/hi3`: This URL points to the context `hi3`, which is the WAR file `hi3.war` deployed on Tomcat.
   - `http://...:8080/hi3/hiTop.html`: This URL points to the **hiTop.html** file in the `hi3` WAR, specifically in the top-level directory.

2. **Jargon in the Deployment**:
   - The term **"context"** is used to refer to the deployed web application.
   - **"Context root"** refers to the root directory of the deployed WAR file, from where all application-related URLs start.

### **Visualization:**

The following image illustrates the **WAR file structure** and how it maps to the URLs:

```
 hi3.war (WAR File)
     |
     +--- hiTop.html             --> http://...:8080/hi3/hiTop.html
     |
     +--- web-assets/
     |        |
     |        +--- hiNested.html  --> http://...:8080/hi3/web-assets/hiNested.html
     |
     +--- WEB-INF/
           |
           +--- web.xml          --> Configuration file (not directly accessible)
           |
           +--- classes/
                  |
                  +--- p1/
                       |
                       +--- HiServlet.class --> Serves HTTP requests
```

This simple structure allows us to understand how files are organized and accessed within a deployed WAR file.

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**

1. **WAR File**: A compressed archive that contains the components of a web app, including HTML files, servlets, and configuration files.
2. **Context and Context Root**: The context is the deployed application, and the context root is the base URL of the application in the Tomcat server.
3. **Navigation**: The structure of the WAR file determines how different files (HTML, Java classes) are accessed via URLs.
4. **Tomcat Configuration**: Tomcat maps URLs to files based on the context and context root, and the `web.xml` file is crucial for defining servlet mappings and other configurations.

This detailed breakdown of WAR file deployment, context, and file structure should help you troubleshoot common issues related to deploying and navigating a web application in a Tomcat server.
