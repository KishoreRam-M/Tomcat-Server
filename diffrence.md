What this statement is explaining is the difference between how **modern browsers** and **RESTful web services** handle HTTP methods and how they are used in the context of web communication.

### 1. **Browsers and HTTP Methods:**
Modern web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) typically allow the **GET** and **POST** methods for making HTTP requests:
- **GET** is used to request data from a server (for example, loading a webpage or fetching an image).
- **POST** is used to send data to a server (like submitting a form or creating new data).

These two methods are supported directly through browsers, and they are commonly used when interacting with websites. However, browsers **do not directly support** all the HTTP methods that are useful for implementing the **full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations.

### 2. **RESTful Web Services and CRUD Operations:**
RESTful (Representational State Transfer) web services, on the other hand, follow a set of rules for creating APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that can be used to perform all four CRUD operations, which are:
- **Create**: Add new data (usually with **POST** or **PUT**)
- **Read**: Retrieve data (usually with **GET**)
- **Update**: Modify existing data (usually with **PUT** or **PATCH**)
- **Delete**: Remove data (usually with **DELETE**)

While **GET** and **POST** are the most commonly used methods for browsers, **RESTful web services** commonly support **all four CRUD operations** by mapping the appropriate HTTP methods to each action:
- **GET** for reading data
- **POST** for creating data
- **PUT** for updating data
- **DELETE** for deleting data

### Why is this important?
- **Browsers** are mainly used for simple, user-facing interactions (like viewing a page or submitting a form), which is why they typically support only the basic GET and POST methods.
- **RESTful web services**, however, are designed to be used programmatically by other applications (like mobile apps, backend systems, or services). These services allow for more complex operations by supporting the full set of HTTP methods to perform complete CRUD functionality, not just simple GET and POST.

### Conclusion:
The statement is pointing out that while **browsers** primarily support **GET** and **POST** for user-based interactions, **RESTful web services** are capable of supporting all **CRUD** operations by utilizing a wider range of HTTP methods, making them suitable for full-fledged application development.
