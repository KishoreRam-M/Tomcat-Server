### EXAMPLE ###

### 1. **Session Expiration**
   - **Concept**: A session on a web application often has a timeout period. If there's no activity from the user for a certain period, the session expires for security reasons.
   - **WhatsApp Web Example**: When you use WhatsApp Web, it mirrors your phone's session. If you're inactive for a while, the session might expire to prevent unauthorized access. You'll see a prompt asking you to re-scan the QR code to log back in.

### 2. **User Logout**
   - **Concept**: Logging out manually from a web application removes the session data from the server, ensuring that no one else can use the session.
   - **WhatsApp Web Example**: When you log out from WhatsApp Web, either manually or via your phone, the session data is deleted from the server. You'll need to log in again with the QR code to start a new session.

### 3. **Server Restart**
   - **Concept**: A server restart may or may not retain session data, depending on how session management is implemented. In many cases, sessions don't persist after a server restart.
   - **WhatsApp Web Example**: If WhatsApp's servers are restarted (for maintenance or other reasons), your session may be invalidated. You'll need to re-scan the QR code to re-establish the connection with your phone.
