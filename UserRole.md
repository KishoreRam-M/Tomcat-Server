### 1. User Authentication: Verifying Identity

**Authentication** is the process of verifying a user's identity by checking their credentials, usually a username and password. This process is critical for ensuring that the user accessing the application is indeed who they claim to be.

#### Example:
- **Machine Login:** When you log into a computer, you enter a username (identity) and a password (credential). The system verifies these details and grants access accordingly.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** AWS uses an access ID (identity) and a hash value generated from a secret key (credential) to authenticate users. AWS then determines the user's access rights based on the verified identity, using a method similar to **HMAC** (Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code).

### 2. Role Authorization: Granting Access Rights

**Authorization** determines what actions an authenticated user is permitted to perform. Once a user is authenticated, the system checks their roles and grants or restricts access to resources based on these roles.

#### Example:
- **Web Application:** After logging in, a user might access certain pages but not others, depending on their role (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).

### 3. The Two Phases of Users/Roles Security

1. **User Authentication (ID + Credential):** This involves verifying the user's identity using a credential.
2. **Role Authorization (Access Rights):** After authentication, the system checks the user's role to determine what resources they can access.

#### Visualization:
```plaintext
              +----------------+             +----------------+
  user ------> | Authentication | ----------> | Authorization  | ------> secured resource (e.g., HTML page)
              +----------------+             +----------------+
                     /                               \
                 required                         optional
```

### 4. Implementing Users/Roles Security in Web Applications

#### 4.1. Application-Managed Security
- **Not Recommended:** This approach involves the application handling authentication and authorization. It is typically ad hoc, hard to maintain, and does not scale well.

#### 4.2. Container-Managed Security
- **Preferred Approach:** In this method, the web container (e.g., Tomcat) handles the authentication and authorization processes, known as **auth/auth**.
- **Benefits:** 
  - Centralized management.
  - Scalable and standardized.
  - Allows integration with external systems like LDAP or JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service).

### 5. Challenges on the Client Side

The primary challenge for clients (e.g., browsers) is to present the identity and credential in a format that the server (web container) expects. Ensuring compatibility is essential for successful authentication.

---

### 6. HTTP Authentication Modes

Several modes are available for HTTP authentication, each with different security implications:

#### 6.1. BASIC Authentication
- **Process:** The browser provides a login form where the username and password are sent as plain text.
- **Security Concern:** Credentials are sent unencrypted, which can be intercepted by attackers.

#### 6.2. DIGEST Authentication
- **Process:** A message digest (hash) of the password, rather than the password itself, is sent to the server.
- **Advantage:** Reduces the risk of credential interception since the actual password is not transmitted.

#### 6.3. FORM-Based Authentication
- **Process:** The web application provides a custom login form. The container handles the authentication and authorization.
- **Preferred Method:** This approach offers better user experience and flexibility.
- **Example:** A web form that captures the username and password, which are then processed by the container using the `j_security_check` mechanism.

#### 6.4. CLIENT-CERT Authentication
- **Process:** A digital certificate is used as both the identity and credential.
- **Use Case:** Common in high-security environments where strong authentication is required.

### 7. Practical Example: Implementing FORM-Based Authentication

1. **Create a Login Form:** The form should have input fields for the username (`j_username`) and password (`j_password`).
2. **Configure `web.xml`:** Define security constraints, login configuration, and role mappings in the `web.xml` file.
3. **Integrate with Realm:** Use a Realm in Tomcat (e.g., JDBCRealm) to store and manage user credentials and roles.
