1. **HTTP Protocol (Request-Response Model)**:
   - HTTP is designed to be a request-response protocol. A client (like a browser) sends a request to a server, and the server responds with data. After that, the connection is typically closed, and a new connection is created for each subsequent request.
   - It works well for traditional web applications where the server responds to the clientâ€™s requests with static or dynamic content.

2. **WebSocket Protocol (Full-Duplex Communication)**:
   - WebSockets, on the other hand, are designed for **full-duplex communication**, meaning both the client and the server can send messages to each other independently and continuously without waiting for a request/response cycle.
   - A WebSocket connection starts with an HTTP handshake to ensure that the client and server can establish a connection. However, after the handshake, the HTTP connection is **"upgraded"** into a WebSocket connection (using the `Upgrade` header in the HTTP request). This upgraded connection allows real-time, two-way communication over the same TCP connection.

3. **Why Can't WebSockets Use HTTP Directly?**:
   - **Protocol Difference**: HTTP is built around request-response cycles, whereas WebSocket is designed to keep a continuous open channel between the client and server for live communication. HTTP doesn't natively support this kind of behavior, which is why it needs to be upgraded to a WebSocket connection.
   - **Port Difference**: HTTP and WebSocket often use different ports and protocols. HTTP uses port 80, while WebSockets use ports like 8080 or other configurable ports depending on the environment. To securely support WebSockets, the server and client need to communicate over the WebSocket protocol (`ws://` or `wss://`), which is designed to be flexible and efficient for real-time applications.

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - **HTTP**: When WebSockets are used over regular HTTP (`ws://`), the connection is not encrypted. This is why the WebSocket protocol has a secure variant called `wss://` (WebSocket Secure) that works over HTTPS, providing the same security features that HTTP/HTTPS offer.
   - **WebSockets over HTTPS (wss://)**: When you use WebSockets over HTTPS (`wss://`), it encrypts the communication, making it secure and resistant to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Key Takeaways:
- **WebSocket is an upgrade** from HTTP, not the same thing.
- The client makes an HTTP request to initiate a connection, but after the handshake, the connection is upgraded to WebSocket (`ws://` or `wss://`).
- This upgrade is what enables real-time, two-way communication between the client and the server, which is the primary benefit of WebSockets over traditional HTTP.
