Modern browsers are designed primarily for general web browsing, where the most common operations are **retrieving data** (like loading a webpage or fetching an image) and **sending data** (like submitting a form). These operations are efficiently handled using the **GET** and **POST** HTTP methods. Let’s explore why browsers typically support only these two methods directly:

### 1. **Simplified User Experience**:
Browsers are built with a focus on simplicity and ease of use for the average user. Most people interact with the web through simple actions like clicking links (which usually triggers a **GET** request) or filling out forms (which typically triggers a **POST** request). These two methods cover the majority of everyday web interactions.

- **GET**: Used to fetch and view resources (e.g., web pages, images).
- **POST**: Used to send data (e.g., submitting a form, creating a new resource).

By limiting support to **GET** and **POST**, browsers keep the interaction model simple and intuitive for users.

### 2. **Security Concerns**:
Allowing other HTTP methods (like **PUT**, **DELETE**, etc.) directly through browsers could expose websites to security risks. For example:
- **PUT** allows the modification of existing resources, and **DELETE** allows resource removal. If browsers were to support these methods directly, malicious websites could potentially manipulate data or delete content on your behalf without your consent.
  
Browsers restrict these methods to prevent misuse and to protect users from performing unintended or harmful actions.

### 3. **HTTP Methods in Forms**:
HTML forms, which are a key component of how users interact with websites, only support **GET** and **POST** methods. **GET** is used when data is requested or when appending query parameters to the URL, while **POST** is used when submitting form data. The browser’s built-in form submission mechanism is designed to use just these two methods because they’re sufficient for most web applications.

For other HTTP methods (like **PUT** or **DELETE**), developers need to implement custom solutions using JavaScript, such as via **AJAX** or **Fetch API**, which can simulate these methods on the client side.

### 4. **Stateless Communication**:
Browsers are typically focused on stateless communication for each request. **GET** and **POST** fit well with this stateless model:
- **GET** is used to retrieve resources without altering the server state.
- **POST** is used to submit data, often leading to changes in the server state, such as creating or updating records.

Other methods like **PUT** and **DELETE** often involve modifying server resources, which would require extra precautions in browsers to ensure the server is being interacted with correctly and securely.

### How Other Methods Work in Web Development:
While browsers don’t natively support methods like **PUT**, **DELETE**, **PATCH**, etc., developers can still implement them using:
- **AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)**: A technique where JavaScript allows for asynchronous communication with the server, enabling the use of other HTTP methods like **PUT** and **DELETE**.
- **Fetch API**: A more modern and flexible way for developers to make HTTP requests from JavaScript, supporting **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, and other methods.

### Conclusion:
Modern browsers directly support **GET** and **POST** for simplicity, security, and user-friendliness. For more complex operations like **PUT** and **DELETE**, developers must use JavaScript to manually configure requests, ensuring that these actions are performed in a controlled, secure manner.
