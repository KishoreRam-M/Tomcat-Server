### 1. Overview of HTTPS Setup in Tomcat

- **Digital Certificate (DC):** Acts as a credential that helps secure communications. In development, a self-signed DC is sufficient, but in production, a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) is necessary.
- **Tomcat Configuration:** Ensures Tomcat can locate and use the self-signed DC to establish secure connections.

### 2. Creating a Self-Signed Digital Certificate (DC)

A **self-signed certificate** is used to secure communication during development. For production, a certificate from a trusted CA is recommended.

#### Steps to Create a Self-Signed DC:
1. **Using `keytool`:** This utility, included with Java, is used to create a DC and store it in a keystore.
2. **Command to Generate a DC:**
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore devel.keystore
   ```
   - **`-genkey`**: Generates a key pair.
   - **`-keyalg RSA`**: Specifies the RSA algorithm.
   - **`-keystore devel.keystore`**: Stores the generated DC in `devel.keystore`, creating it if necessary.

When you run this command, you'll be prompted to provide information such as your name, organization, and password for the keystore.

### 3. Configuring Tomcat to Use the Digital Certificate

Once the DC is created, the next step is to configure Tomcat to use it for HTTPS connections.

#### Steps to Configure Tomcat:
1. **Edit the `server.xml` File:**
   - **Location:** `TOMCAT_HOME/conf/server.xml`
   - This file contains configuration details for Tomcatâ€™s connectors, which handle different protocols like HTTP and HTTPS.

2. **Modify the SSL/TLS Connector:**
   - Find the following section in `server.xml`:
     ```xml
     <!--
     <Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
                maxThreads="150" SSLEnabled="true" scheme="https" secure="true"
                clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
     -->
     ```
   - **Uncomment and modify the section** to include details about the keystore:
     ```xml
     <Connector port="8443"
                protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol"
                maxThreads="150"
                SSLEnabled="true"
                scheme="https"
                secure="true"
                clientAuth="false"
                sslProtocol="TLS"
                keystoreFile="${user.home}/devel.keystore"
                keystorePass="qubits" />
     ```
   - **Explanation of Elements:**
     - **`port="8443"`**: The port for HTTPS connections.
     - **`protocol`**: Defines the protocol to use (HTTP/1.1 with NIO).
     - **`keystoreFile`**: Path to the keystore containing the DC.
     - **`keystorePass`**: Password to access the keystore.

3. **Restart Tomcat:**
   - After making these changes, restart Tomcat to apply the new configuration.

### 4. Testing the HTTPS Connection

Once Tomcat is configured and restarted, test the HTTPS connection:

1. **Open a Web Browser:**
   - Navigate to `https://localhost:8443`.
   - The browser will likely display a warning because the DC is self-signed. You can proceed by accepting the risk temporarily.

2. **Using `curl`:**
   - You can also test the connection using `curl`:
   ```bash
   curl https://localhost:8443 --insecure
   ```
   - The `--insecure` flag is used to bypass the warning about the self-signed certificate.
